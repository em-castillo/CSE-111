Significant Program Proposal
Emily Castillo

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Alarm App.

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
The alarm app will help me to remember to take a break when I am studying in the computer, when its time to cook, or when I need to join a meeting.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
This program will help me to practice functions, its organization and purpose. Also, I will learn how to use a graphical user interface.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
I will use the tkinter and datetime module.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes. Each function will perform a single task like creating the graphics, sounds, inputs, procedure, etc.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
Yes, I will test that each function works well.
